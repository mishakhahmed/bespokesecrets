Secrets Bangladesh — Static Export (Preserved Structure)

Contents:
- Uploaded HTML file(s) exactly as provided
- Any sibling *_files directories with referenced assets (if present)

How to host:
1) Netlify: Drag this folder into a new site; publish directory = root.
2) Cloudflare Pages: Create a project -> Upload this folder.
3) GitHub Pages: Push these files to a repo and enable Pages.
4) Firebase Hosting: `firebase init hosting` -> copy files -> `firebase deploy`.
5) Any static server: Place files in web root; your HTML file becomes the landing page.

Notes:
- Filenames and paths are unchanged.
- If some images/scripts are absolute URLs, they'll still load from their origin.
- If relative assets are missing, add them into the sibling *_files directory.
